## ⚠️ Important Notes
- This project uses **localStorage** to store credentials, which is **not secure** for production use.
- Passwords are stored in plain text. For real applications, always use **server-side authentication** and **password hashing**.
- This project is intended for **learning and demonstration purposes only**.

---

## 🎨 Customization
- Update the gradient background in CSS for a different theme.
- Add more fields (e.g., email) to the registration form.
- Extend functionality with features like password reset, session handling, or multiple users.
